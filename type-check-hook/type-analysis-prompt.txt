Analyze these Python files for type hint issues and security concerns:

Files to check:
{FILES}

Check for:
1. Missing type hints on functions/methods/parameters
2. Generic types (Dict, Any, List, Tuple, dict, list without parameters) that should be Pydantic models or dataclasses
3. Functions returning Dict[str, Any] or plain dict instead of structured types
4. Missing EmailStr or other Pydantic validators where applicable
5. Plain dicts used for structured data instead of Pydantic models
6. SECURITY: Hardcoded API keys, passwords, secrets, or tokens
7. SECURITY: Exposed credentials (AWS keys, database passwords, etc.)
8. SECURITY: Any sensitive data that should be in environment variables

IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:
- If a file has NO issues, output NOTHING for that file (silent pass)
- If a file has issues, list them as numbered items:
  1. Location: file.py:line
     Problem: Brief description
     Suggestion: How to fix
  2. Location: file.py:line
     Problem: Brief description
     Suggestion: How to fix
- NO examples, NO code snippets, NO severity labels, NO issue titles
- Keep it concise and actionable
- For security issues, mark them as CRITICAL in the problem description

If ALL files are clean, respond with: 'All files passed type hint checks.'

Guidelines from CLAUDE.md:
- Use Pydantic BaseModel for ALL structured data
- Avoid Dict[str, Any] - use specific models
- All functions must have type hints
- Use Pydantic validators like EmailStr where appropriate
- NEVER hardcode secrets - use environment variables
